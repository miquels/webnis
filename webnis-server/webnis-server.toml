# This is the configuration file for webnis-server.
#
# The flow for a map lookup is:
#
# - the request url has a 'domain', 'map', 'keyname' and 'keyvalue'.
#   e.g. https://server/.well-known/webnis/<domain>/<map>?<keyname>=<keyvalue>
# - find the [[domain]] from the client's request URL
# - the domain has a authorization password. check it.
# - see if a lookup in 'map' is allowed for this domain.
# - find the 'map' in the configuration (map name and keyname must both match)
# - lookup the key 'keyname' with value 'keyvalue' in the map and return it.
#
# The flow for authentication is:
# - the the url contains a 'domain'. the request uses the POST method, the
#   type is "x-www-form-urlencoded", and a 'username' and 'pasword' are
#   sent in the request body.
# - find the [[domain]] from the client's request URL
# - the domain has a authorization password. check it.
# - the domain has an "auth" key, it points to an "auth" section
#   e.g. auth = "xs4all" -> [auth.xs4all].
# - the auth section tells the server what map to use, and the key
#   to use for the username lookup.
# - if an entry is found, and it has a "passwd" field with an encrypted
#   password, check the passsword the client sent against that.
